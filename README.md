# Number Guessing Game 🎯

A simple Python command-line game where the player tries to guess a hidden number.

## 🔍 How It Works

- The game randomly selects a number (e.g., between 1 and 100).
- The player has **only 8 chances** to guess the correct number.
- After each guess, the game provides hints:
  - "Too high" if the guess is much higher than the target.
  - "Too low" if the guess is much lower than the target.
  - "Almost there!" if the guess is close to the target number.
- If the player guesses correctly, they win.
- If they use all 8 attempts without guessing the number, they lose.

## 🛠 Future Plans

- Add levels of difficulty.
- Add a graphical interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyGame.
- Store player scores and statistics.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x).
2. Run the script in the terminal:

```bash
python guess_number.py
